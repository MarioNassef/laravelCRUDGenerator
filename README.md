This package helps Backend developers to speed up creating dashboard and apis using command line 
Here's how you use it, let's say we have news module so all you have to do is Run the following command in your terminal:

`php artisan generate:adminModule News
`

that will create the following:

1.controller with crud functions
 
2.crud views

3.routes for crud 

4.api controller with crud functions

5.model 

6.transformer

7.migration file 


**Installation** 

Begin by installing the package through Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

`composer require marionassef/lanravel-crud-generator
`

The package will automatically register a service provider and alias.

**but you have to publish** the package's files by running:

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="MarioNassef\LaravelCrudGenerator\LaravelCrudGeneratorServiceProvider"`


that will publish the assets views for admin panel and helper files

**Usage**

by running:
`php artisan 
`
you will find the following commends:

` generate:adminModule  {name}
`

I had described that in above

`generate:adminController {name}`

that will just create admin controller with crud functions


` generate:adminModel    {name}    
` 

that will just create model

`generate:adminRoutes     {name}  
` 

that will just append routes for crud functions in web.php 

`generate:adminTransformer  {name}
` 

that will just create Transformer

`generate:adminViews  {name}
` 

that will just create views 

`generate:apiController {name}
`

that will just create api Controller with crud functions 


that all.

**Please Note** 

this package use unique id for tables by default for security reason you will find documentation   
<p><a href="https://github.com/webpatser/laravel-uuid">Here</a> </p>

if you decided to not use unique id, all you have to do is remove this line from all of your models:

`   protected $incrementing = false;
`

and also use abstract transformer from <p><a href="https://github.com/themsaid/laravel-model-transformer">Here</a> </p>
